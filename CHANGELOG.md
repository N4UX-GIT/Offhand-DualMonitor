# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-09-20
### Added
- **Multi-Monitor Support:** Added full support for complex 3 and 4 monitor setups, including a dedicated monitor selection interface in the Companion App to choose exactly which screens to span.
- **Vertical Stack Support:** Added full support for vertically stacked monitor configurations (Top/Bottom) to both the Addon and Companion App.
- **Auto-Updates:** Added an automatic update checker to the Companion App to notify you when new releases drop on GitHub.
- **Enhanced Heuristics:** The 1-Click Auto-Setup Wizard now automatically detects irregular ultra-wide spanned resolutions and suggests the correct monitor aspect ratio.

### Fixed
- **World Map Dimming:** Fixed a major issue where the World Map would forcefully fade, dim, or close itself while your character was moving during combat.
- **Process Detection:** Expanded Companion App executable detection to reliably hook into any WoW client regardless of region, executable name, or PTR status.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-19
### Fixed
- Fixed a critical issue where the WoW client could permanently save the squished 3D viewport dimensions to its internal layout cache if the addon was disabled or uninstalled. Offhand now gracefully restores the WorldFrame back to full screen milliseconds before the game shuts down or reloads.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-18
### Added
- Initial public release of Offhand - Dual-Monitor Workstation!
- Intelligent 3D viewport rendering to restrict the game world to your primary monitor.
- Companion App for Windows to achieve flawless, borderless window spanning.
- 1-Click Auto-Configuration Wizard for instant calibration.
